Okay... So.

Web page open (localhost/spot) is the Web GUI. Pretty ugly :D
Search in the top right now works and hides/shows correctly. 
As you can see, in the dropdown list, there are tracks that correspond to your search. When you double click them they are added to a database. There's also a button that appears, but that's the one that you can't click on.
Also, need to make it so that when you change pages, (next/previous), it adds the javascript to the rows again. I could do this, just not looked where it is yet. Probably worth adding a general function for adding the events to the rows, rather than the specific one I've written so far.

So yeah, :D.

Also, it's in windows basic to save battery =[. Feel free to turn normal/high performance back on (bottom right, power settings).

I'll explain how the spotify end works another time.

Also, for some strange reason, that I have no idea why, the voting in the main selection (add tracks and then refresh), is completely broken. The page is set to vote.php, but for some reason just returns the content of index (it's set to alert at the minute).
